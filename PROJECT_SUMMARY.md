# Project Summary

## Project Name
**Distributed Virtual Town**

## Project Overview
This is a complete distributed system project that implements a multi-agent virtual town simulation system. Each villager runs as an independent distributed node and can engage in production, trading, sleeping, and other activities. The system achieves global time synchronization through a central time coordinator.

## Course Requirements Met

### ✓ 1. Five Functional Requirements
1. **Villager Management** - Create and manage virtual villagers with multiple attribute configurations
2. **Production System** - Production activities for three occupations (carpenter→house, farmer→wheat, chef→bread)
3. **Trading System** - Item trading between villagers and merchants
4. **Time Synchronization** - Global time management supporting three time periods (morning, noon, evening)
5. **Resource Management** - Complete management system for stamina, currency, and items

### ✓ 2. Two System Architectures

#### Architecture 1: Microservices + gRPC
- **Design Features**:
  - Each villager as an independent gRPC microservice
  - Strong-typed interfaces defined using Protocol Buffers
  - Efficient binary communication
- **File Location**: `architecture1_grpc/`
- **Communication Ports**: 50051-50056

#### Architecture 2: RESTful Resource-Oriented + HTTP
- **Design Features**:
  - Each villager exposes REST API endpoints
  - Data exchange using JSON
  - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- **File Location**: `architecture2_rest/`
- **Communication Ports**: 5000-5005

### ✓ 3. Two Communication Models
- **gRPC**: Used in Architecture 1, high-performance binary protocol
- **HTTP/REST**: Used in Architecture 2, standard web protocol

### ✓ 4. Support for 5+ Nodes
Default configuration for each architecture:
- 1 time coordinator node
- 1 merchant node (system NPC)
- 4 villager nodes
- **Total of 6 nodes**, easily scalable to more

### ✓ 5. Docker Containerization
- Each node can run independently in containers
- Provides Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations
- Supports one-click deployment of the entire distributed system

### ✓ 6. Performance Evaluation
- Implemented complete performance testing framework (`performance_tests/benchmark.py`)
- Test metrics include:
  - **Latency**: Average latency, median, P95, P99
  - **Throughput**: requests/second
- Supports comparative testing of both architectures

### ✓ 7. AI Tool Usage
This project was completed using Claude/Cursor AI assistant for:
- System architecture design and trade-off analysis
- gRPC proto file definitions
- Complete implementation of both architectures
- Test scenarios and performance benchmark code
- Documentation writing and code optimization

### ✓ 8. Git Version Control
- Git repository initialized
- Includes .gitignore configuration
- All source code under version control

## Core Technical Implementation

### Distributed Synchronization Mechanism
- **Central Coordinator Pattern**: Time coordinator responsible for global time progression
- **Event Notification**: Coordinator actively notifies all nodes of time changes
- **State Consistency**: Each node independently manages its own state

### Communication Model Comparison

| Feature | gRPC | REST |
|---------|------|------|
| Protocol | HTTP/2 + Protobuf | HTTP/1.1 + JSON |
| Data Format | Binary | Text |
| Type Checking | Compile-time | Runtime |
| Performance | High | Medium |
| Debugging Difficulty | Harder | Easier |
| Ecosystem Support | Modern frameworks | Wide support |

### Node Design
- **Stateless Design**: Each node can restart independently
- **Loose Coupling**: Nodes communicate indirectly through coordinator
- **Scalable**: Supports dynamic addition of new nodes

## Usage Instructions

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate distribu-town

# Verify environment
python test_setup.py
```

### Quick Start

**Architecture 1 (gRPC)**:
```bash
cd architecture1_grpc
bash start_demo.sh
# Run tests in another terminal
python test_scenario.py
```

**Architecture 2 (REST)**:
```bash
cd architecture2_rest
bash start_demo.sh
# Run tests in another terminal
python test_scenario.py
```

**Complete Demo**:
```bash
bash demo_complete.sh
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Ensure services for both architectures are running
# Terminal 1: cd architecture1_grpc && bash start_demo.sh
# Terminal 2: cd architecture2_rest && bash start_demo.sh
# Terminal 3:
python performance_tests/benchmark.py --requests 100
```

## System Features

1. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of responsibilities
2. **Dual Architecture Comparison**: Deep understanding of trade-offs between different communication models
3. **Complete Functionality**: Full lifecycle from creating villagers to resource management
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new occupations, new items, new nodes
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes automated tests and performance benchmarks

### Technical Highlights

- State consistency challenges

### Architecture Design Trade-offs
- Performance vs usability
- Complexity vs functionality
- Maintainability vs high performance

### AI Tool Application
- Rapid prototype development
- Code generation and optimization
- Architecture design recommendations

## Expected Performance Test Results

Based on design analysis, expected results:
- **gRPC**: Lower latency (~5-10ms), higher throughput (~200-300 req/s)
- **REST**: Slightly higher latency (~10-20ms), medium throughput (~100-200 req/s)

Actual results will be affected by network, hardware, and other factors, but gRPC should have a clear performance advantage.
